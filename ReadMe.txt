nltk: This is the Natural Language Toolkit, a popular Python toolkit for manipulating data related to human language. Text processing, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and other functions are covered by its modules.
LancasterStemmer: This is an NLTK stemming method. Reducing words to their base or root form is known as stemming.
intents: This dictionary maps user intents (like greeting, farewell, gratitude, etc.) to corresponding responses. Each key represents an intent (e.g., "hello") and its value is the response the chatbot should give.

Key Features of NLTK:
Tokenization: Breaking down text into smaller units (words or sentences).

Stemming: Reducing words to their root or base form (e.g., "running" to "run").

Part-of-Speech Tagging: Assigning grammatical tags (like noun, verb, adjective) to words in a sentence.

Parsing: Analyzing the structure of sentences to understand relationships between words.

Named Entity Recognition: Identifying named entities (like names of people, organizations) in text.

Corpora: Collections of text for training and testing natural language models.

WordNet: A lexical database that helps with semantic analysis and word relations.
