nltk: This is the Natural Language Toolkit, a widely used library in Python for working with human language data. It provides modules for text processing, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.
LancasterStemmer: This is a stemming algorithm provided by NLTK. Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root or base form.
intents: This dictionary maps user intents (like greeting, farewell, gratitude, etc.) to corresponding responses. Each key represents an intent (e.g., "hello") and its value is the response the chatbot should give.

Key Features of NLTK:
Tokenization: Breaking down text into smaller units (words or sentences).

Stemming: Reducing words to their root or base form (e.g., "running" to "run").

Part-of-Speech Tagging: Assigning grammatical tags (like noun, verb, adjective) to words in a sentence.

Parsing: Analyzing the structure of sentences to understand relationships between words.

Named Entity Recognition: Identifying named entities (like names of people, organizations) in text.

Corpora: Collections of text for training and testing natural language models.

WordNet: A lexical database that helps with semantic analysis and word relations.
